# How to create a new language pack

To create a new language pack, copy and paste the existing English language pack and translate!
Make sure to change the name of the language pack file to your native language, and then update this bot's config in config.json to reflect that new name.
Then, restart the bot and give it a test!

P.S. it may take a few moments to get a hang of the syntax. :)
