# Discord YouTube Bot
Omg another YouTube Bot for the Discord Bot ecosystem! do we really need another one?

Ah, but I enjoy making Discord bots and sharing my code. So, here it is.

A lot of music bots are private and proprietary (and lock features behind a paywall), and whilst I am sure there are other open source music bots I aim to make this one the best. But no guarantees. Why else would I try?

I am writing this readme file at the very beginning of this project, so fingers crossed it goes to plan!

## Plans
I want this bot to end up being:
- Open source
- Free
- Fast and light
- Secure
- Well written
- Easily extensible
- Simple (this bot will not be advanced at its core!)
- A powerful config that lets you customise the bot's behaviour.

A lot of bold words for a beginner developer that's for sure.

This bot will NOT be a moderation bot, or utility bot. It will be explicitly used for YouTube.

## Technologies
I plan to have this bot run using Discord.js, a free and also open source library for interacting with the Discord bot API with JavaScript as the programming language behind it all.
I will use Redis to store information like queues and playlists. Using a permanent database (I am thinking of MariaDB) is in mind, but I don't plan to add it yet as a lot of starting functionality does not require it.


## Setup
Coming soon! I haven't developed the bot enough yet! But I will look into creating an easy to use Docker image so upgrading and deployment is super easy. Of course an option to download the code as-is will be available and I will provide details on how to set that up too.
